# ðŸ§Š Cubix3D: A Cube-Based Esolang

Cubix3D is a Turing-complete language where you **program by rotating a cube**.  
Each face of the cube represents a different **operation**, and values are stored in a fixed 3Ã—3 grid per face.

## ðŸ§  Design Philosophy

- The cube is **fixed in memory**
- You always operate on the center cell of the **Front face**: `F[1][1]`
- Rotating the cube moves values between faces, **applying functions along the way**
- Each face has its own **behavior** when it becomes the Front

## ðŸ§© Face Behaviors

| Face | Meaning when rotated to Face                      |
|------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `F`  | No-op (identity)                                  |
| `B`  | Changes output mode between letters and numbers   |
| `U`  | Loads a value (or acts as input buffer)           |
| `D`  | Sends value to output                             |
| `L`  | Applies increment                                 |
| `R`  | Applies decrement                                 |

Use `X`, `Y`, `Z` to rotate the **entire cube**, and `F`, `R`, `L`... to rotate individual **faces**.

You can also use `'` (apostrophe) to rotate **counterclockwise**:

| Command | Meaning               |
|---------|------------------------|
| `X`     | Rotate cube around X                 |
| `X'`    | Rotate X CCW                         |
| `R`     | Rotate Right face Clockwise          |
| `R'`    | Rotate Right face Counter-clockwise  |

## ðŸŒ€ Sample Program: Increment and Output

This program:
1. Loads from `U`
2. Rotates to `L` to increment
3. Rotates to `D` to output

```text
U L + D .
```

---

## ðŸ§  Implementation Notes

- All data is stored as integers (0â€“255)
- Only `F[1][1]` is operated on
- You can extend face behaviors (`R` = XOR, `L` = bitshift, etc.)
- Program state is fully visible via debug mode

---

## ðŸ’¡ Future Extensions

- Face functions can be **programmable**
- Stack-based memory (map B as a stack?)
- Multiple pointer modes
- Cube macros: define movement sequences
